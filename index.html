    <h1>Coding Quiz</h1>
    <div class="directions">
      <p>This timed quiz is only masquerading as a coding quiz. It's actually a quiz about _____. Before you click the Start button, note that your score will be tallied and you will be able to see the results at the end, and will be able to leave your initials on the leaderboard! However, answer a question wrong and the countdown timer will knock off a few seconds. Good luck!</p>
